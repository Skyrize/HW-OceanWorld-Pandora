# Ocean World
Ocean World is a 3D Isometric novel battle game where water has flooded the world !

Watch our Game Presentation on YouTube (by Maxime) !​

Explore, gather resources, rescue new crew mates and fight against your foes in order to gather even more loot, trade with merchants, improve your ship and beat the pirate gang and their dangerous lieutenants.

Discover a new story with a new universe by incarnating The Mariner. Your goal is to discover what happened to you and to free the city that is occupied by a mysterious pirate gang.​

You start with nothing but a boat and a turret. You can only do one thing at a time but fear not : throughout your adventure you will meet new people to recruit in order to expand your possibilities and strength.

Manage your boat by positioning weapons such as turrets that shoot rapidly or cannons that deal higher damages. The choice is yours.

You can also repair your ship with the wood you gathered.

Upgrading your ship grant you more space, more resistance, and more mobility.
